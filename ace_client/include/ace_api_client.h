 * escalation of global warming. Be warned.

// --------------- Initialization and deinitialization -------------------------

/*
 * Function type that must be implemented externally and passed to ACE
 * on initialization. This function must show to the user a popup with
 * information on access request to single device capability. Will be used by
 * implementation of ace_check_access API, when policy requires to display
 * popup.
 *
 * Function must be synchronous and must behave accordingly:
 *
 * Function may return value other than ACE_OK, but it will be treated as
 * denial of access.
 *
 * If returned value is ACE_OK, then 'validation_result' must hold information
 * on whether the access was granted or not.
 *
 * Executed function must display a popup with readable information presented to
 * user, covering 'resource_name' that is to be accessed for 'handle' widget
 * which is requesting the access.
 *
 * In its implementation, after the user answered to displayed question,
 * UI handler must call popup answer validation API (ace_validate_answer)
 * from separate, ace-popup-validation library, with passed 'param_list',
 * 'session_id', 'handle' and given answer as arguments. Validation result
 * returned by ace_validate_answer needs to be returned in 'validation_result'
 * parameter of UI handler.
 *
 * 'popup_type' describes what kind of options should be given to user - i.e.
 * ONESHOT prompt only gives possibility to answer Permit/Deny and returned
 * validity for this prompt must be ONCE. PER_SESSION prompt allows to return
 * validity ONCE or PER_SESSION. BLANKET prompt allows to return any validity,
 * as defined in ace_validity_t.
 *
 * This call must be made from properly SMACK labelled, safe process - otherwise
 * the validation will not occur in security daemon and caller will not be
 * granted access to requested device capability.

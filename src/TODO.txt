Security Daemon todos:

* One runtime instance should be allowed (DONE)
* Hide application symbols that should not be exported.
* Add support for service/module dependencies.
* Signals blocking/handlers should be added.
* Connections to other databases should be set.
* Make it a real daemon (demonize ? auto restarting support ?)
* Same of the files needs to be separated from the rest of WebRuntime sources:
    - global_config.cpp
